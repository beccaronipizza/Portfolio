    <h2>Thesis Project</h2>
    <p>My graduate thesis evaluated the effectiveness of nature-based shoreline stabilization techniques used to reduce lateral marsh edge erosion at the Sears Point Levee Adaptive Management Project in San Pablo Bay. Over the first three years post-restoration, I conducted monthly vegetation surveys and elevation monitoring to assess ecological and geomorphic responses. I presented my findings at CERF, the State of the Estuary Conference, and SERCAL.</p>

  <section id="outreach">
    <h2>Outreach</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy sharing science with a wide range of audiences. I've presented my research to scientists, resource managers, and stakeholders at conferences like Coastal & Estuarine Research Federation, State of the Estuary, and the Society of Ecological Restoration, as well as led career talks for high school students interested in science. As an Interpretive Student Aide at the East Bay Regional Park District, I designed and delivered nature walks and educational programs on native wildlife, conservation, and ecosystems throughout the San Francisco Bay. I’ve also organized and led volunteer events including beach cleanups and native plant gardening to help restore local habitats and engage the community in stewardship.

  <section id="vegetation">
    <h2>Vegetation Surveys</h2>
    <p>
      I conducted detailed plant surveys using transects and quadrats, supporting long-term ecological monitoring in brackish and saline tidal marshes. I also have experience surveying riparian vegetation, redwood forest understories, and montane meadows in the Sierra Nevada, contributing to broader ecosystem assessments across diverse California habitats.

  <section id="eelgrass">
    <h2>Eelgrass Monitoring & Restoration</h2>
    <p>
      Over three years in Dr. Katharyn Boyer’s lab, I contributed to the monitoring and restoration of eelgrass beds throughout San Francisco Bay as part of the Living Shorelines project. My work included transplanting eelgrass to restoration sites, conducting vegetation surveys on experimental plots, processing invertebrate and epiphyte samples in the lab, and assisting in mesocosm experiments to study eelgrass growth and its ecosystem interactions. I also mapped eelgrass sites for publication, conducted water quality testing around restoration sites, and supported long-term monitoring to track the success of restoration efforts.
    </p>

  <section id="gis">
    <h2>GIS & Mapping</h2>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience using ArcGIS for a wide range of environmental applications. I’ve created maps for publication, developed digital elevation models (DEMs) from aerial imagery and LiDAR data, and used GIS tools to delineate wetlands on a broad scale. At a finer scale, I have delineated plant communities to track changes over time, supporting restoration and ecological monitoring efforts. My GIS work also includes spatial analysis, data visualization, and the integration of field data to inform environmental assessments and management decisions.

  <section id="elevation">
    <h2>Elevation Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      I have tracked marsh elevation changes over time using advanced on-the-ground methods such as RTK GPS, Trimble Total Station, and Surface Elevation Tables (SETs). My role also involved the installation of SETs to establish long-term monitoring sites. This work has been critical in assessing marsh resilience, understanding responses to climate change, and supporting restoration efforts aimed at preserving coastal ecosystems.

  <section id="waterquality">
    <h2>Water Quality Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      I have hands-on experience using YSI, Hobo, and In-Situ sondes for water quality monitoring in both field sites across the Bay and in mesocosm experiments. My work includes lab calibration, data retrieval, and regular maintenance of these instruments to ensure accurate, reliable data. I have assessed various water quality parameters, such as salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and pH, tracking trends and providing critical insights to support ecological health and restoration efforts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="analysis">
    <h2>Data Analysis & Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      I use both Excel and R for data entry, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), and for producing publication-quality plots to visualize and interpret ecological data. My experience includes cleaning and analyzing field data, creating various types of visualizations, and ensuring data integrity throughout the process. These tools have allowed me to support ecological monitoring projects and communicate my findings effectively through clear and insightful visual representations.
